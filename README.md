Collecting data from NOAA based on a given station's code (e.g. KTOL for Toledo, Ohio).

Basic web backend exercise covering the following topics:
* databases (sqlite3, maybe mysql)
* web scraping (beautifulsoup)


# TODO

* Host data in different formats elsewhere online
* Better SQL script for creating database and station tables
* Django framework for viewing data
* Export to different data file formats (csv, json, etc.)
* Fix date plotting issue (over 2018-19 gap)
