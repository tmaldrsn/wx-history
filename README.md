Collecting data from NOAA based on a given station's code (e.g. KTOL for Toledo, Ohio).

Basic web backend exercise covering the following topics:
* databases (sqlite3)
* web scraping (beautifulsoup)
* basic webdev (flask, jinja2)
* http requests w/ flask


# TODO

* Host data in different formats elsewhere online
* Better SQL script for creating database and station tables
* Export to different data file formats (csv, json, etc.)
* Fix date plotting issue (over 2018-19 gap)	

# LONG TERM GOALS

* Optimize data collection (currently takes about ~30-40 minutes to collect -> sometimes doesn't complete)
* Add hourly forecast viewing (which are also available online per station)
* Machine learning?!?!?
